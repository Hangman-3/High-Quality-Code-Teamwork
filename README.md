##Team Work Requirements
* **Each team member** should have contributions to the project and **commits in the source control
repository in 3 different days**. We acknowledge that this requirement seems a bit unnatural, but
we want to track **how the team collaborates over the time** and that the **project is developed
incrementally**, not in the “last minute”.
